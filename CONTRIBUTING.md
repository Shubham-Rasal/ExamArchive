# Introduction

### Welcome to ExamArchive!

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to ExamArchive. It's people like you that make ExamArchive such a great tool.


### It's good to have some guidelines

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.



### Explain what kinds of contributions you are looking for.

Keep an open mind! Improving test coverage, bug triaging, or writing simple features are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

# Your First Contribution
Help people who are new to your project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.

> Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues that should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.
